## Overview

This project leverages graph theory to analyze and compute mathematical indices pertinent to organic compounds. By representing molecular structures as graphs, it facilitates the calculation of various topological indices that are significant in cheminformatics and molecular chemistry.

## Features

* Representation of organic compounds as mathematical graphs.
* Computation of various graph-theoretical indices.
* Modular and extensible codebase for easy addition of new indices.([github.com][1])

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**: The project is developed in Java. You can download the JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use a package manager like `apt`, `yum`, or `brew` depending on your operating system.

* **Git**: To clone the repository. Download from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: While optional, using an IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) can enhance development and testing.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madddx/MathematicalIndexesForCompounds.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd MathematicalIndexesForCompounds
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**

   If you're using the command line:

   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

   This command compiles all `.java` files in the `src` directory and places the compiled `.class` files in the `bin` directory.

   Alternatively, if you're using an IDE:

   * Open the project in your IDE.
   * Ensure that the `src` folder is marked as the source directory.
   * Build the project using the IDE's build functionality.

## Usage

After successful compilation, you can run the application:

1. **Using the Command Line**

   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

   Replace `Main` with the actual class name containing the `main` method if it's different.

2. **Using an IDE**

   * Right-click on the main class file (the one containing the `main` method).
   * Select the option to run the file.

## Project Structure

The project follows a straightforward structure:

```
